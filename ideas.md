## Bugs

- [x] **Fix Transcription Buffer Overflow**
  - Currently passing fixed 1024 char array to transcription
  - Overflow breaks recording (hotkey stops working)
  - Transcription method should return char* or NULL on error
  - Implement internal dynamic buffer that resizes as needed
  - Reuse buffer across transcription calls for efficiency
- [ ] Test on multi-monitor setups
